        <p class="para-style para-welcome"> We're a home-based baking business that specializes in the making of French macarons,
            a glutenfree pastry item made from ground almonds. Our business began at the West Reading Farmers
            Market in 2011. Last year (2013) marked our third and final season of participation at the market.
            MBoutique was established to pay homage to the delicate French confectionery, the macaron. Our
            shop has been recognized as the connoisseurs of this delicious French pastry because of the
            wonderful variety of flavors from our great master chefs.
