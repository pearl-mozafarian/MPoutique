#### Dear Macarons,

I don't understand you.  I don't like you.  You're Expensive.
You're not delicious.  Your flavor is bland.  Your existence defies my comprehension.
What is your origin any way?  Are you on the American Hipster side of French?

Would Marcus Aurelius be indifferent to your indifference of me?  It is too eary in the morning for this.

Perhaps you were just made using the wrong ingredients. Perhaps you just need a little PHP, sprinkle of My SQL (woa that sounded dirty), and a pinch of Angular, if you catch my angle.  Why is the coffee not kicking in yet?

Would Macarons wake me up better than coffee can?  Can Macarons wake me up better than a can of coffee can?

I will change who you are, macarons.  You will not be static and boring when I am done with you.  And then, may be, our children's children will one day say: I love macarons.  Wait, what...

I bid you farewell, macarons.
