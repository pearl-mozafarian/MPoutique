DEAR MACARONS,

I DON'T LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE EXPENSIVE.
YOU'RE NOT DELICIOUS.
YOUR EXISTENCE DEFIES MY COMPREHENSION.
WHAT IS YOUR ORIGIN ANY WAY, R U ON THE AMERICAN HIPSTER SIDE OF FRENCH?
WOULD MARCUS AURELIUS BE INDIFFERENT TO YOUR INDIFFERENCE OF ME?
IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR THIS.
PERHAPS YOU WERE JUST MADE USING THE WRONG INGREDIENTS.
PERHAPS YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE PHP, A SPRINKLE OF MYSQL AND A PINCH OF ANGULAR.
WHY IS THE COFFEE NOT KICKING IN YET?  WOULD MACARONS WAKE ME UP BETTER THAN COFFEE?
I WILL CHANGE WHO YOU ARE
AND THEN MAY BE, JUST PER CHANCE, OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WILL SAY:
I LOVE MACARONS.
WAIT, WHAT?
URGGGGG

I BID YOU FAREWELL, MACARONS
